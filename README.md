# Iris

I have worked upon the iris dataset that contains the data that classifies various species of flower on the basis of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width. I have run 10 classification models on this particular dataset with each giving a different accuracy then I have ensembled models that were run previously and made an attempt to improve the accuracy.
